====Info====
If you are satisfied that you want to delete the listed items from the data file, click on the ''Confirm deletions'' button.  The ''age
column'' is the length of time that the entry has been in the datafile. Only those entries which are greater than the ''list_age'' setting 
are listed here.  You can change the ''list_age'' setting  in the Configuration Manager.

Dokuwiki saves it files as readable by all. The ''Secure data file'' button will change that so that the data file can be read only
by the web server, if your web server supports this feature.
